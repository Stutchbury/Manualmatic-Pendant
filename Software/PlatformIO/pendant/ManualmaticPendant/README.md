# Manualmatic Pendant PlatformIO Code

This is the PlatformIO port of the Arduono codebase for the Manualmatic Pendant. Still lots of features to be added but all the primary functions are implemented. There will probably be structural changes as we're not no loger constrained by the Arduino IDE.

See User Guide for a full description of implemented functionality.
